# 📊 Linear Regression Practice (Simple & Multiple)

Welcome to my notebook-based practice of **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression** implemented from scratch in Python.

This repository contains well-structured Jupyter notebooks that focus on:

- Building regression models manually (without using high-level libraries like scikit-learn)
- Understanding core statistical concepts through code
- Practicing mathematical intuition behind regression line fitting and accuracy metrics

---

## 📘 Contents

### 1. `simple_linear_regression.ipynb`
- Calculates slope (β₁) and intercept (β₀) using formulas
- Builds prediction equation: \( Y = β₀ + β₁X \)
- Calculates R² (coefficient of determination)
- Error analysis with SSE, SST, and visualization

### 2. `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`
- Regression with two independent variables
- Solves for coefficients: β₀, β₁, β₂ using statistical equations
- Builds model: \( Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ \)
- Calculates R² and Adjusted R²
- Full by-hand solution before Python automation

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Mean, Intercept, Slope
- SSE, SST, R²
- Model fitting by substitution/elimination method
- Visual vs mathematical model validation

---

## 💻 Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- Numpy (for math functions)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a strong statistical foundation in regression modeling by solving problems **manually first**, and then implementing them using **Python functions**. This approach sharpens both **math understanding** and **code writing**.
